## Github-Getter

I've worked on trying to use API's latety so I created this Github profile finder, where you can search users name that will render most of their info from their github profile. TRY IT OUT !!!


### For Starters 

```
You will need to clone this repository.
```

### Now in your terminal

```
git clone [paste repository here...]
```

### If any errors

```
in your terminal type in "npm install".
```
